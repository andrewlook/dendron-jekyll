I'm the founder of dendron.so, a note taking tool based on flexible hierarchies which helps people create, build, reference, and share the information they care about. 

```
this is some code

```
Since we've went into preview close to two months ago, we passed over a thousand downloads and closed over 100 issues worth of features, enhancements, and bug fixes. In that time, our discord community has also now passed the triple digit mark and also includes a group of power users (Dendrologist) who help me answer questions and plan the roadmap.

The initial two months has been way more successful than I hoped and now I find myself stretched pretty thin between working on Dendron and managing the community. I'm now trying to find people to help me build and grow Dendron to the next phase.
